### Background
Last September at dawn, I met someone at a bus stop who planned to commit suicide, overwhelmed by self-loathing and resentment. After dedicating two hours advising her on self-love and managing emotions, I was able to prevent her attempt and ensure her safety. This incident highlighted the urgent need to address the escalating issues of suicide and depression, not just in South Korea but globally. Inspired to make a difference, I developed an app with the hope of saving lives. The app offers intervention strategies for users with suicidal thoughts by highlighting the consequences of common suicide methods and promoting relieve stress through a psychological technique that involves snapping a rubber band on the wrist. If self-hatred is chosen, it reminds users of their worth. Each bead's color has significance, with yellow beads specifically designed to prevent suicide. Additionally, by enabling users to send letters to their future selves, the app fosters hope for tomorrow, encouraging users to continue living at least one more day. For individuals with depression, articulating their emotions in detail is crucial. My goal with this app is to save at least one more life through detailed emotional expression.
